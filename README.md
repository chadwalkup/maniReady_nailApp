# maniReady_nailApp
A JavaScript web app for customizing a client's desired manicure look before heading to the salon.

Author: Chad Walkup
This project is about bringing some relief to nail technicians who are working in salons and have clients who show up for their appointment with no idea what they want on their nails that day. By creating an app that allows clients to "play" with different styles and looks on their own time until they figure out what they want, this will allow the nail technician that extra time to actually do the designs and please their clients better.

Special thanks to Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah. And to the Walter Maxwell Gibson Research Fellowship who assisted in supporting much of the initial design and research for this project.

The setup for this project is as a web-based app. So the current files will include an HTML, CSS, and JS file. The JS contains many calls to the HTML5 Canvas element, so if you are not familiar with that: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp
Which is a link to the basic W3 Schools quick tuitorial and explaination of the element.

Also a great resource for reference to ECMAScript6: http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html#toc_ch_about-es6 
Which is a link to a web-book with searchable terms and table of contents.
